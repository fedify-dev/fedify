Fedify docs
===========

This directory contains the source files of the Fedify docs.  The docs are
written in Markdown format and are built with [VitePress].

In order to build the docs locally, you need to install [Node.js] and [pnpm]
first. Then you can run the following commands (assuming you are in
the *docs/* directory):

~~~~ bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
~~~~

Once the development server is running, you can open your browser and navigate
to *http://localhost:5173/* to view the docs.
