  Fedify provides a way to register inbox listeners so that you can handle
  incoming activities from other actors.  This section explains how to
  register an inbox listener and how to handle errors.

Inbox listeners
===============

In ActivityPub, an [inbox] is where an actor receives incoming activities from
other actors.  Fedify provides a way to register inbox listeners so that you can
handle incoming activities from other actors.

[inbox]: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#inbox


Signature verification
----------------------

The inbox listeners automatically verify the signature of the incoming
activities with various specifications, such as:

 -  Draft cavage [HTTP Signatures]
 -  HTTP Message Signatures ([RFC 9421])
 -  [Linked Data Signatures]
 -  Object Integrity Proofs ([FEP-8b32])

You don't need to worry about the signature verification at all—unsigned activities and
invalid signatures are silently ignored.  If you want to see why some activities
are ignored, you can turn on [logging](./log.md) for `["fedify", "sig"]`
category.

[HTTP Signatures]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-12
[RFC 9421]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421
[Linked Data Signatures]: https://web.archive.org/web/20170923124140/https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/
[FEP-8b32]: https://w3id.org/fep/8b32


Registering an inbox listener
-----------------------------

An inbox is basically an HTTP endpoint that receives webhook requests from other
servers.  There are two types of inboxes in ActivityPub: the [shared inbox] and
the personal inbox.  The shared inbox is a single inbox that receives activities
for all actors in the server, while the personal inbox is an inbox for a specific
actor.

With Fedify, you can register an inbox listener for both types of inboxes at
a time.  The following shows how to register an inbox listener:

~~~~ typescript{7-20} twoslash
// @noErrors: 2345
import { createFederation, Accept, Follow } from "@fedify/fedify";

const federation = createFederation({
  // Omitted for brevity; see the related section for details.
});

federation
  .setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
  .on(Follow, async (ctx, follow) => {
    if (follow.objectId == null) return;
    const parsed = ctx.parseUri(follow.objectId);
    if (parsed?.type !== "actor") return;
    const recipient = await follow.getActor(ctx);
    if (recipient == null) return;
    await ctx.sendActivity(
      { identifier: parsed.identifier },
      recipient,
      new Accept({ actor: follow.objectId, object: follow }),
    );
  });
~~~~

In the above example, the `~Federatable.setInboxListeners()` method registers
path patterns for the personal inbox and the shared inbox, and the following
`~InboxListenerSetters.on()` method registers an inbox listener for the `Follow`
activity.  The `~InboxListenerSetters.on()` method takes a class of the activity
and a callback function that takes a `Context` object and the activity object.

Note that the `~InboxListenerSetters.on()` method can be chained to register
multiple inbox listeners for different activity types.

> [!WARNING]
> Activities of any type that are not registered with
> the `~InboxListenerSetters.on()` method are silently ignored.
> If you want to catch all types of activities anyway, add a listener
> for the `Activity` class.

> [!TIP]
> You can get a personal or shared inbox URI by calling
> the `~Context.getInboxUri()` method.  It takes an optional parameter
> `identifier` to get the personal inbox URI for the actor with the given
> identifier.  If the `identifier` parameter is not provided, the method
> returns the shared inbox URI.

Determining the recipient of an activity
----------------------------------------

### Looking at the `to`, `cc`, `bto`, and `bcc` fields

When you receive an activity, you may want to determine the recipient of the
activity.  The recipient is usually the actor who is mentioned in
the `to`, `cc`, `bto`, or `bcc` field of the activity.  The following shows
how to determine the recipient of a `Create` activity:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { Create, type InboxListenerSetters } from "@fedify/fedify";
(0 as unknown as InboxListenerSetters<void>)
// ---cut-before---
.on(Create, async (ctx, create) => {
  if (create.toId == null) return;
  const to = ctx.parseUri(create.toId);
  if (to?.type !== "actor") return;
  const recipient = to.identifier;
  // Do something with the recipient
});
~~~~

The `to`, `cc`, `bto`, and `bcc` fields can contain multiple recipients,
so you may need to iterate over them to determine the recipient of the activity:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { Create, type InboxListenerSetters } from "@fedify/fedify";
(0 as unknown as InboxListenerSetters<void>)
// ---cut-before---
.on(Create, async (ctx, create) => {
  for (const toId of create.toIds) {
    const to = ctx.parseUri(toId);
    if (to?.type !== "actor") continue;
    const recipient = to.identifier;
    // Do something with the recipient
  }
});
~~~~

Also, the `to`, `cc`, `bto`, and `bcc` fields can contain both actor and
collection objects.  In such cases, you may need to recursively resolve the
collection objects to determine the recipients of the activity:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import {
  Collection,
  Create,
  type InboxListenerSetters,
  isActor,
} from "@fedify/fedify";
(0 as unknown as InboxListenerSetters<void>)
// ---cut-before---
.on(Create, async (ctx, create) => {
  for await (const to of create.getTos()) {
    if (isActor(to)) {
      // `to` is a recipient of the activity
      // Do something with the recipient
    } else if (to instanceof Collection) {
      // `to` is a collection object
      for await (const actor of to.getItems()) {
        if (!isActor(actor)) continue;
        // `actor` is a recipient of the activity
        // Do something with the recipient
      }
    }
  }
});
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> It might look strange, non-scalar accessor methods for `to`, `cc`, `bto`,
> and `bcc` fields are named as `~Object.getTos()`, `~Object.getCcs()`,
> `~Object.getBtos()`, and `~Object.getBccs()`, respectively.

### Looking at the `InboxContext.recipient` property

*This API is available since Fedify 1.2.0.*

However, the `to`, `cc`, `bto`, and `bcc` fields are not always present in
an activity.  In such cases, you can determine the recipient by looking at
the `InboxContext.recipient` property.  The below example shows how to determine
the recipient of a `Follow` activity:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { Follow, type InboxListenerSetters } from "@fedify/fedify";
(0 as unknown as InboxListenerSetters<void>)
// ---cut-before---
.on(Follow, async (ctx, follow) => {
  const recipient = ctx.recipient;
  // Do something with the recipient
});
~~~~

The `~InboxContext.recipient` property is set to the identifier of the actor
who is the recipient of the activity.  If the invocation is not for a personal
inbox, but for a shared inbox, the `~InboxContext.recipient` property is set to
`null`.


`Context.documentLoader` on an inbox listener
---------------------------------------------

The `Context.documentLoader` property carries a `DocumentLoader` object that
you can use to fetch a remote document.  If a request is made to a shared inbox,
the `Context.documentLoader` property is set to the default `documentLoader`
that is specified in the `createFederation()` function.  However, if a request
is made to a personal inbox, the `Context.documentLoader` property is set to
an authenticated `DocumentLoader` object that is identified by the inbox owner's
key.

This means that you can pass the `Context` object to dereferencing accessors[^1]
inside a personal inbox listener so that they can fetch remote documents with
the correct authentication.

[^1]: See the [*Object IDs and remote objects*
      section](./vocab.md#object-ids-and-remote-objects) if you are not familiar
      with dereferencing accessors.

### Shared inbox key dispatcher

*This API is available since Fedify 0.11.0.*

> [!TIP]
> We highly recommend configuring the shared inbox key dispatcher to avoid
> potential incompatibility issues with ActivityPub servers that require
> [authorized fetch] (i.e., secure mode).

If you want to use an authenticated `DocumentLoader` object as
the `Context.documentLoader` for a shared inbox, you can set the identity
for the authentication using `~InboxListenerSetters.setSharedKeyDispatcher()`
method.  For example, the following shows how to implement the [instance actor]
pattern:

~~~~ typescript{5-9,13-18} twoslash
import type { Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
// ---cut-before---
import { Application, Person } from "@fedify/fedify";

federation
  .setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
  // The following line assumes that there is an instance actor named `~actor`
  // for the server.  The leading tilde (`~`) is just for avoiding conflicts
  // with regular actor handles, but you don't have to necessarily follow this
  // convention:
  .setSharedKeyDispatcher((_ctx) => ({ identifier: "~actor" }));

federation
  .setActorDispatcher("/users/{identifier}", async (ctx, identifier) => {
    if (identifier === "~actor") {
      // Returns an Application object for the instance actor:
      return new Application({
        // ...
      });
    }

    // Fetches the regular actor from the database and returns a Person object:
    return new Person({
      // ...
    });
  });
~~~~

Or you can manually configure the key pair instead of referring to an actor
by its identifier:

~~~~ typescript{11-18} twoslash
// @noErrors: 2391
import type { Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
/**
 * A hypothetical type that represents an instance actor.
 */
interface InstanceActor {
  /**
   * The private key of the instance actor in JWK format.
   */
  privateKey: JsonWebKey;
  /**
   * The URI of the public key of the instance actor.
   */
  publicKeyUri: string;
}
/**
 * A hypothetical function that fetches information about the instance actor
 * from a database or some other storage.
 * @returns Information about the instance actor.
 */
function getInstanceActor(): InstanceActor;
// ---cut-before---
import { importJwk } from "@fedify/fedify";

interface InstanceActor {
  privateKey: JsonWebKey;
  publicKeyUri: string;
}

federation
  .setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
  .setSharedKeyDispatcher(async (_ctx) => {
    // The following getInstanceActor() is just a hypothetical function that
    // fetches information about the instance actor from a database or some
    // other storage:
    const instanceActor: InstanceActor = await getInstanceActor();
    return {
      privateKey: await importJwk(instanceActor.privateKey, "private"),
      keyId: new URL(instanceActor.publicKeyUri),
    };
  });
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> If a shared inbox key dispatcher returns `null`, the default `documentLoader`,
> which is not authenticated, is used for the shared inbox.

Making inbox listeners non-blocking
-----------------------------------

*This API is available since Fedify 0.12.0.*

Usually, processes inside an inbox listener should be non-blocking because
they may involve long-running tasks.  Fortunately, you can easily turn inbox
listeners into non-blocking by providing a [`queue`](./federation.md#queue)
option to `createFederation()` function:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
// @noErrors: 2345
import { createFederation, InProcessMessageQueue } from "@fedify/fedify";

const federation = createFederation({
  // Omitted for brevity; see the related section for details.
  queue: new InProcessMessageQueue(),  // [!code highlight]
});
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> The `InProcessMessageQueue` is a simple in-memory message queue that is
> suitable for development and testing.  For production use, you should
> consider using a more robust message queue, such as `DenoKvMessageQueue`
> from `@fedify/fedify/x/deno` module or [`RedisMessageQueue`] from
> [`@fedify/redis`] package.
>
> For more information, see the [*Message queue* section](./mq.md).

If it is not present, incoming activities are processed immediately and block
the response to the sender until the processing is done.

While the `queue` option is not mandatory, it is highly recommended to use it
in production environments to prevent the server from being overwhelmed by
incoming activities.

With the `queue` enabled, the failed activities are automatically retried
after a certain period of time.  By default, Fedify handles retries using
exponential backoff with a maximum of 10 retries, but you can customize it
by providing an [`inboxRetryPolicy`](./federation.md#inboxretrypolicy) option
to the `createFederation()` function.

However, if your message queue backend provides native retry mechanisms
(indicated by `MessageQueue.nativeRetrial` being `true`), Fedify will skip
its own retry logic and rely on the backend to handle retries.  This avoids
duplicate retry mechanisms and leverages the backend's optimized retry features.

> [!NOTE]
> Activities with invalid signatures/proofs are silently ignored and not queued.

> [!TIP]
> If your inbox listeners are mostly I/O-bound, consider parallelizing
> message processing by using the `ParallelMessageQueue` class.  For more
> information, see the [*Parallel message processing*
> section](./mq.md#parallel-message-processing).
>
> If your inbox listeners are CPU-bound, consider running multiple nodes of
> your application so that each node can process messages in parallel with
> the shared message queue.

Error handling
--------------

Since an incoming activity can be malformed or invalid, you may want to handle
such cases.  Also, your listener itself may throw an error.
The `~InboxListenerSetters.onError()` method registers a callback
function that takes a `Context` object and an error object.  The following shows
an example of handling errors:

~~~~ typescript{6-8} twoslash
import { type Federation, Follow } from "@fedify/fedify";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
// ---cut-before---
federation
  .setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
  .on(Follow, async (ctx, follow) => {
    // Omitted for brevity
  })
  .onError(async (ctx, error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> Activities with invalid signatures/proofs are silently ignored and not passed
> to the error handler.


Forwarding activities to another server
---------------------------------------

*This API is available since Fedify 1.0.0.*

Sometimes, you may want to forward incoming activities to another server.
For example, you may want to forward `Flag` activities to a moderation server.
Or you may want to forward `Create` activities which reply to your server to
your followers so that they can see the replies.

The problem is that the recipients of the forwarded activities will not trust
the forwarded activities unless they are signed by the original sender, not by
you.  You might think that you can just `~Context.sendActivity()` the received
activity to the recipient in your inbox listener, but it doesn't work because
the signature made by the original sender is stripped when the received activity
is passed to the inbox listener, and `~Context.sendActivity()` will sign the
activity with your key.

To solve this problem, you can use the `~InboxContext.forwardActivity()` method
in your inbox listener.  It forwards the received activity without any
modification, so the signature made by the original sender is preserved
(if the activity is signed using by the original sender).

The following shows an example of forwarding `Create` activities to followers:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { Create, type Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";
const federation: Federation<void> = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
federation.setInboxListeners("/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
// ---cut-before---
.on(Create, async (ctx, create) => {
  if (create.toId == null) return;
  const to = ctx.parseUri(create.toId);
  if (to?.type !== "actor") return;
  const forwarder = to.identifier;
  await ctx.forwardActivity({ identifier: forwarder }, "followers");
})
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> The `~InboxContext.forwardActivity()` method does not guarantee that the
> forwarded activity is successfully delivered to the recipient, since
> the original sender might  neither sign the activity using [Linked Data
> Signatures](./send.md#linked-data-signatures) nor [Object Integrity
> Proofs](./send.md#object-integrity-proofs).  In such cases, the recipient
> probably won't trust the forwarded activity.[^2]
>
> If you don't want to forward unsigned activities, you can turn on
> the `skipIfUnsigned` option in the `~InboxContext.forwardActivity()` method:
>
> ~~~~ typescript twoslash
> import { type InboxContext } from "@fedify/fedify";
> const ctx = null as unknown as InboxContext<void>;
> // ---cut-before---
> await ctx.forwardActivity(
>   { identifier: "alice" },
>   "followers",
>   { skipIfUnsigned: true },
> );
> ~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> The `~InboxContext.forwardActivity()` method does not use a [two-stage
> delivery process](./send.md#optimizing-activity-delivery-for-large-audiences),
> because `~InboxContext.forwardActivity()` method is invoked inside inbox
> listeners, which are usually running in the background task worker.

[^2]: Some implementations may try to verify the unsigned activity by fetching
      the original object from the original sender's server even if they
      don't trust the forwarded activity.  However, it is not guaranteed
      that all implementations do so.


Constructing inbox URIs
-----------------------

To construct an inbox URI, you can use the `~Context.getInboxUri()` method.
This method optionally takes an identifier of an actor and returns
a dereferenceable URI of the inbox of the actor.  If no argument is provided,
the method returns the shared inbox URI.

The following shows how to construct an inbox URI of an actor identified by
`5fefc9bb-397d-4949-86bb-33487bf233fb`:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import type { Context } from "@fedify/fedify";
const ctx = null as unknown as Context<void>;
// ---cut-before---
ctx.getInboxUri("5fefc9bb-397d-4949-86bb-33487bf233fb")
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> The `~Context.getInboxUri()` method does not guarantee that the inbox
> actually exists.  It only constructs a URI based on the given identifier,
> which may respond with `404 Not Found`.  Make sure to check if the identifier
> is valid before calling the method.

The following shows how to construct a shared inbox URI:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import type { Context } from "@fedify/fedify";
const ctx = null as unknown as Context<void>;
// ---cut-before---
ctx.getInboxUri()
~~~~


Manual routing
--------------

*This API is available since Fedify 1.3.0.*

If you want to manually route an activity to the appropriate inbox listener
with no actual HTTP request, you can use the `Context.routeActivity()` method.
The method takes an identifier of the recipient (or `null` for the shared inbox)
and an `Activity` object to route.  The point of this method is that it verifies
if the `Activity` object is made by the its actor, and unless it is, the method
silently ignores the activity.

The following code shows how to route an `Activity` object enclosed in
top-level `Announce` object to the corresponding inbox listener:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { Activity, Announce, type Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";

const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;

federation
  .setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
// ---cut-before---
  .on(Announce, async (ctx, announce) => {
    // Get an object enclosed in the `Announce` object:
    const object = await announce.getObject();
    if (object instanceof Activity) {
      // Route the activity to the appropriate inbox listener (shared inbox):
      await ctx.routeActivity(ctx.recipient, object);
    }
  })
~~~~

As another example, the following code shows how to invoke the corresponding
inbox listeners for a remote actor's activities:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { Activity, type Context, isActor } from "@fedify/fedify";

async function main(context: Context<void>) {
// ---cut-before---
const actor = await context.lookupObject("@hongminhee@fosstodon.org");
if (!isActor(actor)) return;
const collection = await actor.getOutbox();
if (collection == null) return;
for await (const item of context.traverseCollection(collection)) {
  if (item instanceof Activity) {
    await context.routeActivity(null, item);
  }
}
// ---cut-after---
}
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> The `Context.routeActivity()` method trusts the `Activity` object only if
> one of the following conditions is met:
>
>  -  The `Activity` has its Object Integrity Proofs and the proofs are signed
>     by its actor.
>
>  -  The `Activity` is dereferenceable by its `~Object.id` and
>     the dereferenced object has an actor that belongs to the same origin
>     as the `Activity` object.
