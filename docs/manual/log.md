Logging
=======

*This API is available since Fedify 0.7.0.*

> [!TIP]
> We highly recommend enabling logging in your federated server app to debug

Fedify uses the [LogTape] package to log message.  You can enable logging in
your federated server app by installing the `@logtape/logtape` package and
configuring it in the entry point of your app.

[LogTape]: https://logtape.org/


Setting up LogTape
------------------

To enable logging in your federated server app, you need to install the
`@logtape/logtape` package (available on both [JSR] and [npm]):

::: code-group

~~~~ sh [Deno]
deno add jsr:@logtape/logtape
~~~~

~~~~ sh [npm]
npm add @logtape/logtape
~~~~

~~~~ sh [pnpm]
pnpm add @logtape/logtape
~~~~

~~~~ sh [Yarn]
yarn add @logtape/logtape
~~~~

~~~~ sh [Bun]
bun add @logtape/logtape
~~~~

:::

Then, you can [`configure()`] the logger in the entry point of your app:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { AsyncLocalStorage } from "node:async_hooks";
import { configure, getConsoleSink } from "@logtape/logtape";

await configure({
  sinks: { console: getConsoleSink() },
  loggers: [
    { category: "your-app", sinks: ["console"], lowestLevel: "debug" },
    { category: "fedify",   sinks: ["console"], lowestLevel: "error" },
  ],
  contextLocalStorage: new AsyncLocalStorage(),
});
~~~~

The `configure()` function takes an object with three properties:

`sinks` (mandatory)
:   An object that maps sink names to sink instances.  In this example, we use
    the `getConsoleSink()` function to get a console sink instance.

`filters` (mandatory)
:   An object that maps logger categories to filter functions.  In this example,
    we use an empty object to disable filtering.

`loggers` (mandatory)
:   An array of logger configurations.  Each configuration is an object with
    four properties:

`loggers.category` (mandatory)
:   The `category` property is an array of string or a string that specifies
    the logger category.  If a string is given, it is treated as an array
    with a single element.

`loggers.sinks` (optional)
:   The `sinks` property is an array of string that specifies the sink names
    that the logger should use.

`loggers.filters` (optional)
:   The `filters` property is an array of string that specifies the filter
    names that the logger should use.

`loggers.lowestLevel` (optional)
:   The `lowestLevel` property is a string that specifies the log level.
    The log level can be one of the following: `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warning"`,
    `"error"`, or `"fatal"`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `lowestLevel` property was introduced in LogTape 0.8.0.  Prior to
    > LogTape 0.8.0, please use the `level` property instead of `lowestLevel`.

`contextLocalStorage` (recommended)
:   *This property is available since LogTape 0.7.0.*

    An instance of [`AsyncLocalStorage`] that is used to store
    [implicit contexts] of the log messages.  This is useful when you want to
    trace the log messages in a specific context.

Categories
----------

> [!TIP]
> A logger category is an array of strings that specifies the logger category.

Sinks
-----

A sink is a destination where log messages are sent.  LogTape provides few
built-in sinks:

 -  [console sink]
 -  [stream sink]
 -  [file sink]
 -  [rotating file sink]
 -  [OpenTelemetry sink]

However, you can create your own sink by implementing the [`Sink`] interface,
e.g., to send log messages to a database or a cloud service.

For more information about sinks, see the [*Sinks* section] in the LogTape docs.

[console sink]: https://logtape.org/manual/sinks#console-sink
[stream sink]: https://logtape.org/manual/sinks#stream-sink
[file sink]: https://logtape.org/manual/sinks#file-sink
[rotating file sink]: https://logtape.org/manual/sinks#rotating-file-sink
[OpenTelemetry sink]: https://logtape.org/manual/sinks#opentelemetry-sink
[`Sink`]: https://jsr.io/@logtape/logtape/doc/~/Sink
[*Sinks* section]: https://logtape.org/manual/sinks


Deprecation warnings
--------------------

When you are using deprecated APIs, you can see deprecation warnings in the
log messages.  The deprecation warnings are logged with the `"warning"` level
in each category where the deprecated API is used.  If you want to see all
deprecation warnings, you can set the log level to `"warning"` for the
[`"fedify"` category](#fedify).


Tracing
-------

*This feature is available since Fedify 1.2.0.*

> [!CAUTION]
> Traceable log messages rely on [implicit contexts] which was introduced in
> LogTape 0.7.0.  If you don't configure `contextLocalStorage` in
> [`configure()`], you cannot trace log messages.

The most of log messages made by Fedify can be traced by either below two
properties:

`requestId`
:   If the log message is made in the context of an HTTP request,
    the `requestId` property is included in it.  The `requestId` is a unique
    identifier for the HTTP request, which is derived from one of the following
    headers:
    
     -  [`X-Request-Id`]
     -  `X-Correlation-Id`
     -  [`Traceparent`]
     -  Otherwise, the `requestId` is a unique string derived from
        the current timestamp and the random number.

`messageId`
:   If the log message is made in the context of a background task,
    the `messageId` property is included in it.  The `messageId` is a unique
    identifier for the background task, which is a UUID. 

When you want to trace log messages, first of all you need to use a sink that
writes log messages as structured data.  For example, you can use
a [file sink] with a [JSON Lines] formatter.  Oh, and don't forget to set
`contextLocalStorage` in [`configure()`]!  To sum up, you can configure
loggers like this:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { AsyncLocalStorage } from "node:async_hooks";
import { getFileSink } from "@logtape/file";
import { type LogRecord, configure } from "@logtape/logtape";

await configure({
  sinks: {
    file: getFileSink("fedify-logs.jsonld", {
      formatter(record: LogRecord): string {
        return JSON.stringify(record) + "\n";
      }
    })
  },
  loggers: [
    { category: "fedify", sinks: ["file"], lowestLevel: "info" },
  ],
  contextLocalStorage: new AsyncLocalStorage(),
});
~~~~

If your loggers are configured like this, you can filter log messages by
`requestId` or `messageId` in the log file.  For example, you can filter log
messages by `requestId` using [`jq`]:

~~~~ sh
jq -r 'select(.properties.requestId == "your-request-id")' fedify-logs.jsonl
~~~~
